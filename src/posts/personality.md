Hi there!

I loved Typora's editing experience, but it has since become a paid app... On the lookout for an alternative, I used Marktext - an open-source app - for a while, but it proved itself to be somewhat buggy. After many more frustrated attempts, I turned to VS Code. Though not aesthetically pleasing, VS Code was reliable and met my needs.

Then, I learnt that VS Code's core editor, Monaco, was open-source. That's when the idea of adapting Monaco to fit my needs came to be. That's how [Elementary](https://bogosorter.github.io/elementary/) was born. The core of Elementary is based on Monaco and should provide a reliable and bug-free experience. I did, however, change all of the editor's styles for aesthetic's sake, and built the logic that makes this a standalone app. Elementary uses electron and react, put together by the electron-react-boilerplate.

[This](https://bogosorter.github.io/elementary/) is Elementary's website. You can download it [here](https://bogosorter.github.io/elementary/#download)

I hope you'll become interested in the project and give it a try!
